# StataTools
My user-written commands/packages for data analysis in Stata

The included packages are:
`exampleobs` prints (randomly selected) example observations and optionally stores the values in a local macro. This is useful to explore possible values of a variable in your data set without being biased by the ordering of the data.
`head` prints the head observations (first observations in data set) and mimics the `head()` function in R and `head` command in Linux.
`randomselect` prints (randomly selected) example observations and optionally stores the values in a local macro. This is useful to explore possible values of a variable in your data set without being biased by the ordering of the data.
`tail` prints the tail observations (last observations in data set) and mimics the `tail()` function in R and `tail` command in Linux.

These packages can be downloaded directly through Stata using `ssc install <package_name>, replace`
